# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

A data science project with Python regarding Dr. Sommelweiss Handwash's data.

This is a Datacamp Project. If you're active there, you may find a project about Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing. But, since this project has been used in many data scientists' portfolios, we're going to modify some of the things here and there to distinguish ourselves a little bit :).


## Project Description

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthrough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands were a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

The language used: Python
