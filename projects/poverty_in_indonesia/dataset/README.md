Anyway, the datasets is planned to cover poverty from year 2002 to 2021. But due to the challenging task of extracting and cleaning the data from pdfs, also time constraint,
the scope might be reduced to only year 2010 to 2021.

It's still incomplete now, but I will try to rush it as fast as possible since I kinda found the optimal way to extract it.

The year available now are:
- 2020
- 2021
