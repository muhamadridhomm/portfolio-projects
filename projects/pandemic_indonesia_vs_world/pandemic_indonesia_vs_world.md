{: .no_toc }

Two years ago, in 2020, the world is swept by a storm of a virus, named Covid-19 that spreads chaos everywhere. This virus has started emerging in Wuhan, China and now, almost no single area that is populated by people is unreached. In this study, weâ€™re going to take a look at how the cases started and how is it going now.
